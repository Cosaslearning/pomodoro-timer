This project is a web-based Pomodoro Timer, which helps users manage their time effectively by alternating between focused work intervals and short breaks. The project incorporates HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a visually appealing and functional timer. We have provided an optimized version of the code with comments to explain each step.

**What is Pomodoro Timer:**

The Pomodoro Timer is a time management technique that helps you work more efficiently. You break your work into 25-minute focused intervals (Pomodoros) followed by short 5-minute breaks. After four Pomodoros, take a longer break. This method can boost productivity and concentration.

**HTML File (index.html):**

- The HTML file sets up the structure of the web page. It includes a header with a logo and the title "Pomodoro Timer," a timer section, and buttons for focus, short breaks, and long breaks.
- It references external resources, such as the Font Awesome library for icons and external CSS for styling.

**CSS File (style.css):**

- The CSS file provides styling for the entire web page, including the logo, header, timer, and buttons.
- It sets variables for colors, fonts, and shadows, which are used throughout the project.
- The styles are optimized for a visually appealing Pomodoro Timer user interface.

**JavaScript File (script.js):**

- The JavaScript file contains code for the Pomodoro Timer functionality.
- It sets up variables to control the timer, buttons, and the active timer mode (focus, short break, or long break).
- Functions are defined for starting, pausing, and resetting the timer, as well as for switching between different timer modes.
- Event listeners are used to trigger these functions when buttons are clicked.

This project creates a Pomodoro Timer web application with adjustable timer intervals for focus and breaks. Users can start, pause, and reset the timer. It is visually appealing and functional, incorporating external resources for icons and fonts. The JavaScript code manages the timer and handles user interactions effectively.
